OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = doc/generated

# Build related configuration options

# The WebGPU C API does not have cases of symbols only differing by case, so
# we can afford to turn this to YES even on non-case sensitive file systems.
# This options helps getting slightly better path names, although it is still
# overall not satisfying so as soon as we have a proper way to generate good
# human-memorable URLs we could turn this back to NO or SYSTEM.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# No need to show header file, since there is only webgpu.h. When using this
# Doxyfile with implementation-specific extensions (e.g., wgpu.h), it could
# be useful to turn this back to YES.

SHOW_HEADERFILE        = NO

# Instead of letting Doxygen sort definition alphabetically, we have it rely
# on the order from webgpu.h. Since the latter is auto-generated, we can
# expect the order there to be sound and consistent.

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated
# output files in an output format independent way. To create the layout file
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option. You can
# optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted DoxygenLayout.xml
# will be used as the name of the layout file. See also section "Changing the
# layout of pages" for information.
#
# Note that if you run doxygen from a directory containing a file called
# DoxygenLayout.xml, doxygen will parse it automatically even if the LAYOUT_FILE
# tag is left empty.
